Mobile banking


The topic of the diploma project is online banking emulation - CloudyBank24.

The site has a main page, a navigation menu and a user's personal account. The client of the bank already has a physical card that he received at the bank branch, and also has a login and password for logging in. On the "login" page there are examples of user logins and passwords - to enter the personal account and use additional functions, such as - viewing all user's cards, balance and payments history, transferring funds from your card to another your card or to another user's card by its number, as well as the transfer of funds to charitable funds.

The site is still under development and will be supplemented with additional functions.
